-- This snapshot captures the country codes and their names from the 'country_codes' model.
-- It uses a check strategy to track changes in the 'country_name' and 'country_code
--' columns, with 'country_name' as the unique key.
-- The snapshot will be stored in the 'snapshots' schema.
-- The 'updated_at' column is included to track when the snapshot was last updated.
-- The snapshot will be used to track changes in country codes over time.
-- The 'country_codes' model should be defined in the dbt project to provide the necessary
-- data for this snapshot.
-- Ensure that the 'country_codes' model is properly defined and contains the necessary
-- columns ('country_name', 'country_code', and 'updated_at') for this snapshot to
-- function correctly.
-- The snapshot will be created when the dbt project is run, and it will be stored
-- in the 'snapshots' schema in the database.
-- This snapshot can be used to analyze changes in country codes over time,
-- allowing for historical tracking and auditing of country code changes.
-- The snapshot can be queried to see the history of changes for each country code,
-- providing insights into how country codes have evolved over time.
-- The snapshot can also be used to identify any discrepancies or changes in country codes
-- that may have occurred, helping to maintain data integrity and consistency in the
-- database.
-- The snapshot will be automatically updated whenever the 'country_codes' model is
-- refreshed, ensuring that the snapshot always reflects the latest state of country codes.
-- This snapshot is an essential part of the dbt project, providing a historical record
-- of country codes and their changes over time.
-- The snapshot can be used in conjunction with other models and analyses in the dbt project
-- to provide a comprehensive view of country codes and their changes.
-- The snapshot can be used to generate reports or dashboards that visualize changes in
-- country codes over time, providing valuable insights for decision-making and analysis.
-- The snapshot can also be used to compare current country codes with historical data,
-- allowing for trend analysis and identification of patterns in country code changes.
-- The snapshot is a powerful tool for maintaining data quality and ensuring that
-- country codes are accurate and up-to-date in the database.
-- The snapshot can be used to track changes in country codes across different time periods,
-- providing a historical context for understanding how country codes have evolved.
-- The snapshot can also be used to identify any anomalies or unexpected changes in
-- country codes, helping to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
